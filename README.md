# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is the first project I build with js. Thanks to all the good people work at the LighthouseLabs and my colleagues.
Without the help from all of them, I wouldn't be able to finish this simple app.

It is a simple but full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).
